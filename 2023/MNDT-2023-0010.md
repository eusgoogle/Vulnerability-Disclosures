## CVE Reference
CVE-2023-37243

CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

The C:\Windows\Temp\Agent.Package.Availability\Agent.Package.Availability.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots. Since the C:\Windows\Temp\Agent.Package.Availability folder inherits permissions from C:\Windows\Temp and Agent.Package.Availability.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges.

## Resolution
The issue was fixed in version 0.15.0.0.
