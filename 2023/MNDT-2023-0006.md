# MNDT-2023-0006

## Description
A Stack-based Buffer Overflow exists in TP-Link's Kasa EC70 Security Camera handling of authenication credentials.

## Impact
High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a network connected attacker a root shell on the device.

## Exploitability
High - Requires access to the same network, but otherwise an user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is simple to produce.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2023-28478

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 8.8 - Vector: AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details
The TP-Link EC-70 (Kasa Spot Pan Tilt) wireless security camera contains an
exploitable stack-based buffer overflow in the Authentication header of multiple
services, allowing an unauthenticated attacker on the same network to execute
arbitrary code as the 'root' user on the device. Specifically, the
`tpsocket_base64_decode()` function does not perform any bounds checking while
decoding the supplied password value into a fixed length buffer stored on the
stack in the authentication callback function for the media-serviced
(tcp/19443), ulinkied (tcp/10443), speaker (tcp/18443), and storaged (tcp/17443)
services. 

In order to reach the vulnerable code, an attacker needs to know the username
associated with the device. This information can be obtained by requesting
smartlife.cam.ipcamera.cloud get_info method in a UDP packet to port 9999. The
returned encoded json contains the username as one of the fields. Encoding and
decoding the blobs is trivial, as the TP-Link Smart Home Protocol has been
documented.

The Authentication header data is base64 decoded, and if the content before the
first ':' character doesn't match the username, the authentication callback
returns failure immediately. Otherwise an MD5 hash of the data following the
first ':' character is checked against the MD5 of the current password. If this
does match, then the callback returns success, otherwise the password data is
base64 decoded again, and this value is hashed and checked against the current
password, this time into a 128-byte long stack-based buffer. The
`tpsocket_base64_decode()` function does not have a parameter for the maximum
output length, and is often used in the code to decode "in place", overwriting
the original buffer. When used with a fixed length buffer to decode untrusted
input, an exploitable buffer overflow can occur.

## Resolution
The issue is fixed in version 2.3.20 Build 20230424 rel.58785, which can be installed
by upgrading the firmware on the device (if it has not already automatically
updated).
